# NIT-Delhi-Sports-Club-Management-
The NIT Delhi Sports Club Management System is built in Python Django Framework for backend and HTML, CSS and JavaScript for web frontend.

In my college, we get to know about sports events either by mail or notice board. So, I decided to build a SCM system.(In my local System)

It contains user auth features for login/register and a user dashboard for viewing all the events and registering to them. This system also provides an admin panel from where all the users, events and bookings can be managed.

Future scope of this project is that we can implement the organizing, monitoring and reporting and Ability to reserve equipment in advance on any equipment used by sports facilities. It makes overall process easier and smoother for future
